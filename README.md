### ⚙️ SQL Operations Demonstrated:

| Operation                           | Purpose                                                    |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SELECT`                            | Retrieve data from one or more tables                      |
| `SELECT DISTINCT`                   | Return only unique (non-duplicate) values                  |
| `AS`                                | Rename columns or tables using an alias                    |
| `WHERE`                             | Filter rows based on a condition                           |
| `AND`                               | Combine multiple conditions that must *all* be true        |
| `OR`                                | Combine conditions where *at least one* must be true       |
| `IN`                                | Filter rows by matching against a list of values           |
| `BETWEEN`                           | Filter rows within a range (numbers, dates, text)          |
| `LIKE`                              | Filter rows using pattern matching (e.g., searching text)  |
| `JOIN` (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`)   | Combine data from multiple tables based on related columns |
| `GROUP BY`                          | Group rows to perform aggregated calculations              |
| `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `COUNT` | Aggregate functions used to summarise data                 |
| `ORDER BY` (`DESC`, `ASC`)          | Sort results in ascending or descending order              |
